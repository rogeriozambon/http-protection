## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching in [issues](https://github.com/rogeriozambon/http-protection/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rogeriozambon/http-protection/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in [issues](https://github.com/rogeriozambon/http-protection/issues) and start writing code.
* Do not open a pull request until you have collected positive feedback about the change.
